There is nothing like motivation, there is only discipline. Unfortunately people’s greatest enemy is their lack of it. By creating Habit Guard we aim to revolutionize the way new habits are formed. When starting a new habit, we often let our laziness take over, that's the reason approximately 80% of New Year's resolutions fail. Recognizing the challenge, we leverage the loss aversion - psychological phenomenon, which acts as a natural determinator and reminder about your resolution. Habit Guard, lets participants wager money they are willing to lose over giving up a habit. Success in continuing your habit earns back part of the stake. Psychology tells us, such a person is less likely to resign from their resolution, having a threat of losing their money. If they fail, the credit is lost, but on a good cause, as it will be donated to a charity promoting the well-being of humankind in general. Habit Guard, bridging discipline and altruism, boosts personal growth.
